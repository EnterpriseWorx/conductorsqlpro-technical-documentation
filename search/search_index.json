A key advantage of this solution is that it can greatly reduce a lot of the frustration when managing multiple databases over erratic networks because of its automation capabilities. It supports multiple database technologies such as MS SQL Server, Azure SQL, MySQL and PostgreSQL. The Conductor4SQL Modules Conductor4SQL is divided into modules, taking the pay for what you need approach. SQLClassic - the original classic version of Conductor4SQL and is limited to just MS SQL Server. You can read more about this edition here https://enterpriseworx.github.io/conductor4sql-technical-documentation/ . SQLPro - a module focused on mundane task automation and monitoring. Live Alerts - Intermediately know about issues such as No comms, Low disk space, failing jobs, long-running queries (MS SQL Server only) Centralised Query - Query multiple instances of multiple database types (MS SQL Server, Azure SQL, MySQL and PostgreSQL) using the standard SQL syntax from a centralised location. Backup & Maintenance - Configure local or cloud database backups and database maintenance from a central location (MS SQL Server only) Auditing - Audit DDL changes and create email alerts for any defined dangerous changes. SQLSense - a module focused on sensitive data detection and checking on database access to that sensitive data. This greatly assists with data protection compliance.","title":"Home"},{"location":"#conductor4sql-overview","text":"Conductor4SQL is an advanced database management solution that permits organisations to effectively manage a large number of database instances with an unlimited number of databases, especially those which are dispersed over a large geographic area.

SQLPro allows one to make use of Azure blob storage and backup to the cloud with an estimated limit on backing up 100GB databases. Setup Azure Database Backups With SQLPro, offsite backups to Azure Blob Storage is a simple process. Warning Some Microsoft Azure experience is advised for using this guide.

To do this go to the Azure Portal and select Create a Resource >> Storage account Take note of the Storage account name as you'll need this name later. Select Review + create followed by the Create button after reviewing the selections. It's also worth taking note of the Region , Performance and Redundancy settings and selecting options that will work for your organisation. Go to your new Storage Account and select the Containers section. Create a new container called database-backups or any other name you like and take note of it. Now there are two types of credentials for the storage container that work with SQLPro: Shared access token (preferred) - create credentials for the container Shared access signature - create credentials for the entire storage account Shared Access Token To create a shared access token open the new container that you've created and select the Shared access tokens Under Permissions select Read and Write .

No Server Activity Auditing in 24 hours - flags servers that have had nothing changed or reported within the last 24 hours as it would be unusual in production environments. Alert Details If the alert is red then SQLPro has detected an issue. You can click on the show more icon (top right of the alert card) to see more details. Alert History The alerts also have history for any past alerts that were fired. To view the alert history click on the show history icon (also top right of the alert card).

To enable auto refreshing, simply toggle the Enable button. You can also adjust the schedule that the refresh occurs by changing the cron string for the Schedule field. Finally click on the Save button once you are done. Live Alert Summary Email Sending alerts on every issue can result in a fair amount of unwanted email. To combat this, you can enable a summary email which has the status of all live alerts and lists the instances that have issues and the counts of that issue. This way the intended audience will get a single email for all the issues rather than an email per issue. To configure the live alert summary click on the Live Alert Summary Email tab. Enable the email by toggling on the Enabled toggle. Select the Email List of recipients and adjust the schedule by changing the cron string for the Schedule field. Note By default the email is scheduled to arrive at 8:05 AM but this can easily be changed by adjusting the text in the cron Schedule field Finally click on the Save button once you are done. Schedules The schedules for the Live Alerts module is highly configurable as each schedule is just a cron string. Each schedule line item has two schedules: Send Cron Schedule - the schedule in which the live alert query is run against the instance Email Cron Schedule - when this schedule fires an email is sent for all live alerts with issues using this schedule To edit the schedule click on the Edit button.

You can create roles as long as you have AdminRoleUpdate permission. Setup LDAP (Active Directory) Instead of having to create local users for each person wishing to interact with SQLPro it's often easier to use Microsoft's Active Directory. This way users do not have to remember another password for another system, and it's also more secure than using local logins. SQLPro supports LDAP which Microsoft uses Active Directory. First thing you'll need to do is find out where your AD server is located. So open the Command Prompt line on your central server hosting SQLPro and run the following command set l | find /i \"LOGONSERVER=\\\\\" In our example the AD server name is TEST-AD1, take note of your AD server location. Next in SQLPro, you'll need to go to the Administration >> Users screen and select the Edit Configuration button. Fill in the LDAP Host field with your AD server location and in most cases keep LDAP Port as 389 and click on Save . When adding a new User, make sure you select LDAP User for Authentication Type . Also include your domain name in the Username field. Now you should be able to log in as this user using normal AD credentials (remember to include your domain name in your username) Setup and Enable Azure AD Integration SQLPro also supports Azure Active Directory In order to use Azure AD logins the first step is to log into Azure Portal and navigate to the Azure Active Directory screen https://portal.azure.com/#view/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/~/Overview .
